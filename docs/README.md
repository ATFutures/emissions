The routino profiles used in `dodgr` are given for foot, horse,
wheelchair, bicycle, moped, motorcycle, motorcar, goods, hgv, psv, which
map only these categories for Kathmandu:

| Type             | routing category |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Bus              | psv              |
| Mini Bus         | psv              |
| Truck/Mini truck | goods or hgv     |
| car/Jeep/van     | motorcar         |
| Pickup           | otorcar          |
| Micro Bus        | motorcar         |
| Motorcycle       | motorcycle       |

The routino profiles for these are all identical, so only one routing
layer need be generated for all of these. The following converts these
to annual
emissions:

``` r
nms <- c ("bus", "minibus", "car", "taxi", "microbus", "motorbike", "hgv",
          "truck")
aavkt <- c (44105, 43307, 12310, 25356, 38520, 8952, 37800, 37415)
pm10 <- c (1.075, 1.075, 0.12, 0.12, 0.48, 0.06, 1.24, 1.1)
nvehicles <- c (6127, 5307, 62500, 6700, 1500, 475812, 2995, 20869)
daily_emissions <- aavkt * pm10 * nvehicles / (1000 * 365)
names (daily_emissions) <- nms
message ("Kathmandu aggregate daily PM10 emissions = ",
         format (round (sum (daily_emissions)), big.mark = ","), " kg")
#> Kathmandu aggregate daily PM10 emissions = 5,295 kg
```

This daily figure can then simply be distributed across the network
according to estimated flow densities.

## Accra

Estimated Vehicle Population in all of Ghana:

| vehicle   | population |
| --------- | ---------- |
| motorbike | 203756     |
| car       | 677292     |
| bus       | 145144     |
| truck     | 75175      |
| hgv       | 21993      |

Populations of Accra and Ghana are 2.27 and 28.3 Million, reducing these
figures to 16344, 54327, 11642, 6030, and 1764. Using the above AAVKT
figures for Kathmandu, this would give

``` r
nms <- c ("motorbike", "car", "bus", "truck", "hgv")
aavkt <- c (8952, 12310, 44105, 37415, 37800)
pm10 <- c (0.06, 0.12, 1.075, 1.1, 1.24)
nvehicles <- c (16344, 54327, 11642, 6030, 1764)
daily_emissions <- aavkt * pm10 * nvehicles / (1000 * 365)
names (daily_emissions) <- nms
message ("Accra aggregate daily PM10 emissions = ",
         format (round (sum (daily_emissions)), big.mark = ","), " kg")
#> Accra aggregate daily PM10 emissions = 2,663 kg
```

This figure canâ€™t be assumed as reliable as the above Kathmandu figure,
because there is no information on average annual vehicle kilometres
travelled.
